 PLPBasicGitAssignment
 In order to achieve this I followed the following steps:
 1. First I created a new repository on GitHub and named it PLPBasicGitAssignment.
 2. Then I created a folder through gitbash on my desktop and named it PLPBasicGitAssignments.
 3. I initialized the folder as a git repository using the command "git init".
 4. Then I created a new file named "README.md" and added some text to it
 5. I then proceeded to create a hello.txt file with the vim editor and after succesfully inserted the text I used the git add command.
6. This command adds it to the staging area, followed by a commit message with the command git commit -m.
7. The last step is to push the changes to the origin master with the command git puush origin master.
